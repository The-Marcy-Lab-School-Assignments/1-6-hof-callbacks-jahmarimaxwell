# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer
Nums is not a function. forEach is the function that we want to use in order to accept printDouble(). With our "myForEach" function that we wrote, we would accept an array and a callback function like so:
```jsx 
const myForEach = (arr, callback) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    let num = arr[i];
    callback(num);
  }
  return undefined;
};

const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
myForEach(nums, printDouble)
```
